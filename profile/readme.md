# Builder Component

This **Angular standalone component** seamlessly integrates with [Reveal](https://revealbi.io) to empower users to dynamically build dashboards or view single visualizations through an intuitive, point-and-click visualization catalog experience.

---

## üöÄ Overview

### Key Modes:

1. **Single Visualization Mode**
   - Click a visualization from the catalog to display it maximized in its own `RevealView` instance.

2. **Generated Dashboard Mode**
   - Select multiple visualizations to dynamically assemble a custom dashboard. Save or reset your dashboard effortlessly.

Driving adoption for BI and dashboards can be challenging. By providing an easy-to-use visualization catalog, organizations can accelerate data-driven decision-making. Users can create dashboards, save them for reuse, and integrate them into a shared or corporate catalog.

## ‚ú® Features

### üîç **Visualization Catalog**
- **List of Visualizations:** Dynamically load a catalog of `VisualizationChartInfo` objects via the `RevealServerService`.
- **Icon-Based Interface:** Clean UI for selecting and adding visualizations.

### üìä **Single Visualization Display**
- Maximize any visualization by clicking on it.
- Use a dedicated `RevealView` to provide an uninterrupted view of the chosen visualization.

### üñºÔ∏è **Dashboard Creation**
- Combine selected visualizations into a dynamic dashboard.
- Generate an `RdashDocument` with multiple `VisualizationChartInfo` objects.

### üíæ **Save & Reset Dashboards**
- Handle naming collisions and dashboard overwrites using the `onSave` event.
- Include a custom ‚ÄúClear/Reset‚Äù option to quickly start fresh.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

### 1. **Retrieving Visualization Data**
The Reveal server fetches metadata for available visualizations, including titles, file references, and IDs. This populates the visualization list.

### 2. **Single Visualization Mode**
Clicking a visualization loads the associated `RevealView` and maximizes the view for detailed analysis.

### 3. **Dashboard Generation**
- Visualizations are added to a collection when selected.
- The `generateDashboard()` function creates a new `RdashDocument` from these visualizations, converting it to an `RVDashboard` for display.

### 4. **Saving Dashboards**
The `onSave` event ensures dashboard names are unique, prompting the user if overwrites are necessary.

### 5. **Resetting Dashboards**
The ‚ÄúClear/Reset‚Äù option removes all visualizations, resetting the dashboard for new configurations.

## üîë Key Methods

### 1. **`loadVisualizationChartInfo()`**
- Retrieves visualization metadata and auto-selects the first visualization for single visualization mode.

### 2. **`listItemClick(item: VisualizationChartInfo)`**
- Loads a single visualization in a `RevealView`, showing it maximized.

### 3. **`iconClick(item: VisualizationChartInfo, event: MouseEvent)`**
- Adds a visualization to the dashboard if not already selected.
- Calls `generateDashboard()` to dynamically create the dashboard.

### 4. **`generateDashboard()`**
- Combines selected visualizations into an `RdashDocument`.
- Updates the `RevealView` with the newly generated dashboard.

### 5. **`setupRevealView()`**
- Configures the `RevealView` for dashboard management.
- Handles save events and custom menu options, including ‚ÄúClear/Reset‚Äù.

### 6. **`resetDashboard()`**
- Clears all selected visualizations and resets the `RevealView`.

## üìö Additional Details

### Visualization Catalog

Using the Reveal SDK DOM, visualizations from server-side dashboards are dynamically listed with titles, icons, and IDs. Users can:
- Click to view visualizations individually.
- Add them to a custom dashboard using the "+" icon.

### Dashboard Behavior

The dashboard creation logic is entirely client-side. Adding a new visualization recreates the dashboard view to accommodate the updated layout.

- **Auto Layout:** Ensures a clean and responsive design.
- **Client-Side Rendering:** Allows users to resize and rearrange visualizations.
